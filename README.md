## Age of Kingdoms
This is a turn-based, text-based strategy game inspired by Age of Empires.

#### Purpose
First, I would like to write a major project in Python, and second, I'd like to
do some object-oriented programming.

### Scope
I am not sure. Here are some major questions to resolve:
 - How will the map be represented? And how will I create maps?
 - How will the units move?
