## Age of Kingdoms
This is a turn-based, text-based strategy game inspired by Age of Empires.

#### Purpose
First, I would like to write a major project in Python, and second, I'd like to
do some object-oriented programming.

### Scope
I am not sure. Here are some questions to resolve:
 - How will the map be represented? And how will I create maps?
 - How will buildings be built? To what extent can the player specify "where"
 to build them?
 - How will the units move?
 - Will villagers need to drop off resources once collected or not?
 - Will units only be able to do one thing during a turn? (Or for example can a
 swordsman attack for part of a turn and then enter a building to rejuvenate
 for the rest of the turn?)
 - How will I make the AI? (This is a major project in itself. I think I'll
 create something very simple first. Eventually, I'd like to make the AI smart
 enough that I cannot beat it when two computer players play together against
 me.)
 - Will people be able to play against each other online? (I'm thinking not for
 a while if at all.)
