## Age of Kingdoms
This is a turn-based, text-based strategy game inspired by the real time strategy game Age of Empires.

### Potential employers, please read
I started this project before I knew anything about OOP. For instance, I hadn't
even heard of information hiding at that time. Also, note that this project
is far from complete. Finally, note that all the code was written before working 
as a software engineer.

### Purpose
Build a major project in Python, one that is significantly more
substantial than anything I've done before. Also, I want to practice
doing object-oriented programming.

### Game manual
For a description of how to use this program, read manual.txt

### Dependency
This game uses the Python package colorama. If you don't want to install that
package for some reason, then if you are using macOS or Linux, then just
open the file colors.py (in a text editor) and delete these two lines:

- from colorama import init
- init()

### Initially limiting the scope
I intend to implement the most essential features first, leaving some of the other
features for later, in case I have the time at some point. Here are some major
features not yet implemented that I intend to get to:
 - the ability to attack other players (This feature is absolutely essential.)
 - a random map generator
 - an AI
 - the ability to play over a network
