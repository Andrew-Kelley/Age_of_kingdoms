## Age of Kingdoms
This is a turn-based, text-based strategy game inspired by Age of Empires.

#### Purpose
First, I would like to write a major project in Python, and second, I'd like to
do some object-oriented programming.

#### Scope
I am not sure. Here are some questions to resolve:
 - How will the map be represented? (As a Python list of lists.)
 - How will I create maps?
 - How will the units move?
 - Will villagers need to drop off resources once collected?
   Ans: No, but they need to be within a certain distance
   of a resource building such as a lumbercamp (for chopping wood).
 - Will units only be able to do one thing during a turn? Yes.
 - Will military units be produced "from scratch" from military buildings or
   will villagers go to military buildings to be trained?
   Ans: They will be produced "from scratch".
 - How will I make the AI? (This is a major project in itself. I think I'll
 create something very simple first. Eventually, I'd like to make the AI smart
 enough that I cannot beat it when two computer players play together against
 me.)
 - Will people be able to play against each other over some network? (I'm thinking not for
 a while if at all.)
