# The design plan

### Ages
 - Stone Age
 - Bronze Age (100 food, 500 wood, 200 stone)
 - Iron Age (500 food, 300 gold, 300 bronze)

### Resources
 - food
 - wood
 - stone
 Can only be collected in the bronze age and later:
 - gold
 - bronze
 Can only be collected in the iron age:
 - iron

#### Sources of food
Hunting, berry bushes, farms (possibly supplemented with cows and/or chickens)

### Civilizations
 I think for now, there will only be one civilization.

### Buildings
 - town center
 - house
 For collecting resources:
 - farm
 - lumber camp
 - stone quarry
 - mining camp
For defense:
 - wood wall (with gates)
 - stone wall (with gates)
 - towers
 - castles
 Military unit producing/training:
 - barracks
 - archery range
 - stable
 - siege works
 Other buildings:
 - blacksmith
 - Library
 - market

## Units
   - villager
   - pikeman
   - swordsman
   - archer
   - knight

#### Town center
(Iron Age) Every player begins with a town center.
Cost: 300 wood, 200 stone
Hit points:
Can build: villagers (50 food)
Can research: the next age
Can garrison: 50 units
Defensible: True (i.e. units garrisoned shoot arrows at attackers)
Population support: 20 units

#### House
(Stone Age)
Cost: 100 wood
Can garrison: up to 10 units
Defensible: False
Population support: 10

#### Farm
(Bronze Age)
Cost: 100 wood, 20 food
I think that the following should be researched elsewhere:
Can research: plow (bronze age), windmill (iron age)

#### Lumber camp
(Stone Age)
Cost: 100 wood

#### Stone quarry
(Bronze Age)
Cost: 100 wood

#### Mining camp
(Bronze Age)
Cost: 100 wood

#### Wood wall
(Stone Age)
Cost: 5 (or 10?) wood per unit length

#### Stone wall
(Bronze Age)
Cost: 5 (or 10?) stone per unit length

#### Tower
(Bronze Age)
Cost: 50 wood, 120 stone
Can garrison: 10 units
Defensible: True

#### Castle
(Iron Age)
Cost: 500 stone, 200 wood, 100 iron
Can garrison: 75 units
Defensible: True

#### Barracks
(Stone Age)
Cost: 150 wood
Can garrison: 20 units
Defensible: False
Can build: pikeman (stone age), swordsman (bronze age)

#### Archery range
(Bronze Age)
Cost: 150 wood
Defensible: False
Can build: archer

#### Stable
(Iron Age)
Cost 150 wood
Can build: knight

#### Siege works
(Bronze Age)
Cost 150 wood
Can build: battering ram, catapult, trebuchet (Iron Age)

#### Blacksmith
(Bronze Age)
Cost: 150 wood, 25 stone
Should blacksmiths create armor for each unit or should they research better
armor and have the research apply automatically to every unit (of a specified
type)?

#### Library
(Iron Age)
Cost: 200 wood, 100 gold
Can research:
 * Physics (necessary to build trebuchet)
 * [Fill in more things]
