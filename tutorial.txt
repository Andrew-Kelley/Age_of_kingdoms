This document is a brief tutorial of this game.

Throughout this document, quotes are used, but when
entering the commands, don't type the quote marks.

The commands are case insensitive. You can use capital or lower case
as much as you want.

When you are done with your turn, type "finished"
or "done"

These are the possible first words in a command:
'build', 'select', 'move', 'print', 'set', 'collect',
'chop', 'mine', 'research', 'farm',
'help', 'commands'

Another command is 'help build'.


----------------------------------------------------
---------THE POSITION OF A BUILDING OR UNIT---------

The position of a unit is printed to the user by a tuple (i, j), representing
that it is at row i and column j. So i is how far up or down it is, with a
smaller value of i meaning it is further up (i.e. north) on the map, and j
represents how far left or right it is, with a smaller value of j
meaning it is further to the left (i.e. further west).

The position of a building is the position of its lower left
(i.e. south west) corner.

-------------------------
---------THE MAP---------

Resources and buildings are shown on the map but (as of now) units are
not printed on the map. Currently, any number of units may be in the
same position. Also, a unit can be in any position, regardless of
whether or not there are resources there or a building there.

A building shows up on the map immediately after a villager is
commanded to build it.

----------------------------------------------
---------TO SELECT A UNIT OR BUILDING---------

In order to move units or to build buildings, the units doing the action must
first be selected. Similarly, to build units from a building or to research
something from a building (or set its default build position), the
building must first be selected.

To select villager number 1, type this:
"select villager 1"

To select villagers 1, 2 and 3, type this:
"select villagers 1-3"

Similarly to select pikemen 5 through 10 (if they have been built already)
type this:
"select pikemen 5-10"

To select all villagers, if you have say 12 built, you can type this:
"select villagers 1-20"
You can also replace 20 with any number >= 12.

To select towncenter number 1, type this:
"select towncenter 1"
or, if you can type this:
"select towncenter"
Any command of the form "select <building type>" without a building number,
will select the building number 1 of that building type. (The same is
true for selecting units.)

----------------------------------------------------------------
---------PRINTING UNITS, THE MAP, AND CURRENT RESOURCES---------

To see what a unit or units is/are currently doing, first select it/them,
and then type the following command:
"print"

To print the part of the map centered at (i, j), type this:
"print map i j"

Note that if you select a unit and then print the map, the unit is still
selected. So the command "print" will do the same thing whether or not
you print the map between selecting the unit and printing the unit.

To print what resources you currently have, type this:
"print resources"


-------------------------------
---------TO MOVE UNITS---------

First select the unit or units to be moved.

Next, type something like this:
"move w5"  (meaning this: move west 5, i.e. left 5)
or
"move e2 n6" (meaning: move east 2 and north 6, i.e. move left 2 and up 6)

If a unit is at position (i, j), then (if it is selected) the command
"move n3 e2" changes its position to (i-3, j+2).

In one turn, units can move through a distance of 15. So for example, they
can move north 10 and east 5 (via the command "move n10 e5") or they could
move south 2 and east 13, etc. Later on, when siege weapons are implemented,
those units will probably be able to move less per turn. Also, mounted troops
(i.e. knights) will be able to move more per turn.


NOTE: Later on, it would be nice if you could simply command units
to move to an actual map location. So the following type of command
should be implemented: "move to 70 40".

--------------------------------
---------TO BUILD UNITS---------

First select the building that will be building the units.
For example, type "select towncenter" and then type this:
"build <num to be built>  <unit type>"
e.g. "build 2 villagers"

If you only want to build one, than you can also type "build villager"
instead of "build 1 villager"; both commands work the same.


---------------------------------------------------
---------TO SET THE DEFAULT BUILD POSITION---------

If you want units built from a building to go towards a certain
location on the map once the units are built, then you can set
the building's default build position as follows:

First select the building. Then type this:
"set default build position <a>  <b>" where you replace <a> and <b>
with integers so that (<a>, <b>) is a position on the map.
e.g.
"set default build position 71 80"

Actually, the word "default" is optional in the command. So this works too:
"set build position 71 80"

Whenever you set the build position from a towncenter, you are
asked if you want villagers to start collecting a certain
resource once they arrive at their build position. When prompted,
simply type the name of the resource you want them to collect.

--------------------------------------
---------TO COLLECT RESOURCES---------

First make sure that the villagers are close enough to the
desired resource. (Currently, that means to be within a
distance of 6 of the resource.) Then, once the villager(s)
are selected type this:
"chop wood"
or "collect wood"
or "collect stone"
or "collect food"
etc.

If the given resource is within 6 spots of the villager,
then the villager is allowed to instantly move to such
a nearby resource and collect that resource this turn.

Note that other than farms, to collect a resource, the
resource must be within a distance of 15 of an appropriate
building. A towncenter is appropriate for collecting any
resource. For the other resources, the following buildings
also work:
wood: lumbercamp
stone: stonequarry
gold: miningcamp
bronze: miningcamp
iron: miningcamp


After a farm has been built at position (i, j), if fewer
than 2 villagers are farming it, then you can command a
villager to farm it with the following command (after
selecting the villager):
"farm i j"
So, for example, if the farm is at position (82, 71), then
type this:
"farm 82 71"


-------------------------------------
---------TO BUILD A BUILDING---------

First select a villager or some villagers. Then,
to build a building at position (i, j) type this:
"build <name of building> i j"
For example:
"build lumbercamp 70 75"

If a villager is not close enough to the where the building is to be
built, then the above command will first cause the villager to move
to the correction position, and then the villager will build the
building.

Note that to build a building in a certain place, there can't
be any other building or resource (such as wood, stone, etc.)
occupying any part of the space that the building would take up.

A farm can be built (in the bronze age and on)
by selecting one or two villagers and then building
the farm as if it were any other building. Villagers who build the
farm automatically start farming it when it is built.


          The buildings that can be built (and when):

------In the stone age (and on)-------
'house', 'lumbercamp', 'stonequarry', 'miningcamp', 'barracks'
not yet implemented: 'woodwall'

------In the bronze age (and on)-------
'farm', 'tower', 'archeryrange', 'siegeworks', 'blacksmith', 'market'
not yet implemented: 'stonewall', 'wallfortification'
As of yet, towers and markets don't do anything.

------In the iron age-------
'towncenter', 'castle', 'stable', 'library', 'wonder'
As of yet, castles, libraries, and wonders don't do anything.

------------------------------------------
---------TO HELP BUILD A BUILDING---------

If a villager is currently building a building, then you can
command other villagers to help build a building. For example,
if a villager is building a barracks at position (70, 56),
then you can select other villagers and then type this:
"help build barracks 70 56"


--------------------------------------------------------------
---------TO RESEARCH THINGS eg. ADVANCE TO BRONZE AGE---------

To advance to the bronze age, select the towncenter and type this:
"research bronze age"
(There is currently no requirement to being able to research it
other than simply having the resources.)

To advance to the iron age, you only have to have the needed
resources and have advanced to the bronze age.

To research something at the blacksmith, (first build one then)
select a blacksmith building and then type this:
"research <name of thing to be researched>"
eg.
"research bronze tipped plows"
or
"research bronze picks"


TODO: CHECK if at a blacksmith, you have to research the bronze version
of something before researching the iron version. (That's how I ought
to implement it.)

TODO: Add short descriptions of what different research gets you


----------------------------------------------------------
---------DIFFERENCES FROM THE GAME AGE OF EMPIRES---------

Up to two villagers can farm each farm, and a farm never runs out
of food. In other words, you never have to rebuild it.

When a villager farms, food is automatically added to the player's
food resource. (Note that a farm can be built and used anywhere;
there is no need to be within a certain distance of a towncenter.)


-----------------------------
---------OTHER NOTES---------


Note:
There is an unfinished help system already built into the game.
You can type this command:
"print commands"

TODO: Have the in-game help system print parts of this tutorial.

Note:
Suppose you have a current population of 18 and a population cap
of 20.
If you command a towncenter to build, say 4 villagers, then
only 2 will be built (as it should be), and then it says you've
reached the population cap (as it should be). But if you
then build a house, the towncenter will not continue to build
the other 2 extra villagers.

Note:
Each towncenter increases the population limit by 20, and
each house increases it by 10. This goes up until the total
population limit, which as of now, is set to be 300.
