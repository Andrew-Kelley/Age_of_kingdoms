Here are the lessons I've learned while working on this project.

(As should be evident, there are things I learned that I haven't yet
added to this document.)

------  Sacrificing usability to make programming slightly easier is NOT
------  worth it

At the beginning of this project, I made a design decision on how the
game_map indexing works. I'm pretty sure I knew it would make playing the
game slightly more difficult. However, it also made programming it slightly
easier. Making the game fun to play wasn't high on my priority list, and so
I decided to take the route that was easier in the short term.

After playing the game a decent amount, I realized that the confusion my
design decision causes wasn't worth making the programming slightly simpler,
and so I decided to change the game_map indexing to make it how it ought to be.
This change took a few hours to implement. Doing it right the first time
would have only cost me perhaps an extra 15 or 20 minutes.
